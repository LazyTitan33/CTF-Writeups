## My Solution

The provided `.eml` message file looks like this when opened in Outlook:

We see a mention of `fortified` which seems like a hint:

The two .dat files are in fact pictures. The second one drew my attention as it had a bit more to work with in terms of interesting things to look at:

On the right side, we can see a partial sign with some text, zoomed in it looks like this:

Googling the part of the words that can be seen with the word fort (as indicated by the fortified from the email) and the word plaque, because that's what it is, we see the exact same plaque we have in the picture:

The plaque itself contains the location: `Reckord Armory`

Answer: `Reckord Armory`
