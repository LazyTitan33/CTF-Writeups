## My Solution

When running the provided binary in [CommandoVM](https://github.com/mandiant/commando-vm) with [ProcMon](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/procmon) running we can see it trying to make requests on a `supermegasus.huntress.local` domain via http, so port 80.

So I stood up a netcat server on localhost port 80 after adding the domain in the hosts file and ran the binary again:

As we can see, it is making requests to me. While it was doing that, I created a process dump from Task Manager and ran strings on it greping for the flag and found it. Pretty cheesy.
