## My Solution

We see that the provided .vbs file executes script:

So I replaced the Execute with `WScript.Echo` to echo out the unravelled payload instead when we run it.

The next stage seems to be pinging some IPs.

However, if we separate the numbers in the IPs and decode them from decimal, we get our flag. We can again use [cyberchef](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/#recipe=From_Decimal('Space',false)&input=MTAyIDEwOCA5NyAxMDMgMTIzIDU0IDEwMCA0OSA5OCA1NCA0OCA1MiA5OCA5OCA0OSA5OCA1NCAxMDAgOTcgNTEgNTAgOTggNTYgOTggOTggOTkgOTcgNTcgMTAxIDUwIDU0IDEwMCA1MyA0OSA1MyA1NiA1NyAxMjUgMzUgMzU&oeol=FF).
