This month long CTF from [Huntress](https://www.huntress.com/) was much tougher than last year's. There were many more RE challenges which required a much better knowledge of assembly, golang or rust than I have or care to develop.

That being said, I did still get a slightly better position on the scoreboard than last year so I'm happy with that. Got 90th out of 3444 teams, which is top 2.6%.
